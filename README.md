# The-Matplotlib-Cookbook
This Jupyter notebook is a summary of my learnings. I have learnt matplotlib from various sources. In this notebook, I have tried to explain how things work in matplotlib using my own examples. I hope you will like it :) For those who already know matplotlib, you can use this as a reference notebook!
